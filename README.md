Enemy Upgrade Overhaul for Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
=======

Enemy Upgrade Overhaul is my own personal twist on a randomized system for buffing enemies. 

# Features
* Upgrades are split into various groups, which then have individual types housing each upgrade.
* Each upgrade type has an adjusted chance according to the difficulty of the upgrades.
* Each upgrade within each type has their own individual chance - tougher upgrades are rarer.
* Enemies have a total "Challenge Point" amount equal to the difficulty of their upgrades. More CP = chances for better loot.
